# base-supervisor

Base image that hosts the general software to host another services. Includes these main tools:

> supervisor
> rsyslog
> logrotate
> cron
> ssmtp

## Getting Started

This image is intended as a base for other containers, where is useful to have some software already in place. Also some configuration is expected to be added for correct behavior.

### Supported tags and respective  `Dockerfile`  links

- [`latest`  (Dockerfile)](https://github.com/janskola/base-supervisor/blob/master/Dockerfile)

### Example usage

> TODO

#### Volumes

- `/var/log` - Log files provided by rsyslog

#### Useful File Locations

Configuration directories comes from Debian logic, so as you would expect, you can configure included software here:

- `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/` - Folder for placing configuration file for log files rotation
- `/etc/logrotate.d/` - Folder for placing configuration file for log files rotation

## Build

Image debian/stretch-slim is used as a base.
